# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- `.github/workflows/ci-failure-autofix.yml` — Rewrote workflow to fix four CodeQL findings: (1/2) code injection: all `workflow_run` context values (`head_branch`, `head_sha`, `id`) moved to job-level `env:` vars and referenced as `$VAR` in shell — never as `${{ }}` inside `run:` steps; (3/4/5) untrusted code checkout: switched from checking out the PR branch to checking out master only, fetching the failing branch as a non-executed ref, and diffing via `git diff` — untrusted branch code is never executed in the privileged runner context. Added fork guard (`head_repository.full_name == github.repository`).

### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/ci-failure-autofix.yml` — Fixed non-fast-forward push rejection (Codex P1): the "Commit and push" step previously committed on master's history then pushed to the feature branch, which is rejected because the branch has diverged. Now: restore master to clean state, create a local branch at `origin/$AUTOFIX_BRANCH`, apply the verified patch with `git apply --3way --index` (tolerates minor context differences), commit, and push as a true fast-forward. Emits a workflow warning if the patch does not apply to the branch tree.

### Fixed
- `provider_router.py` — Bedrock routing affinity now also enforced in the last-resort cooldown-bypass loop; previously a Bedrock model ID could be silently routed to Nvidia NIM when all providers were on cooldown (P1 bug reported by Codex review).
- `provider_router.py` — `from_env()` default Bedrock model changed from `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` (requires AWS Sales approval) to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`; fixes `AccessDeniedException` for accounts without Opus 4.7 access (P1 CodeRabbit finding).
- `render.yaml` — Updated Bedrock comment to reflect `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` as the confirmed-accessible default.
- `tests/test_bedrock_live.py` — Default `_MODEL_ID` changed from `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` (requires AWS Sales approval) to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` so live tests pass with the current account's access level when `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` env var is not set (P2 bug reported by Codex review).
- `tests/test_bedrock_live.py` — Moved `from __future__ import annotations` to before module docstring (Python 3.13 compatibility); replaced `print()` with `log.info()` via module-level logger; added `-> None` return type annotations to all 4 test functions.
- `tests/test_bedrock_provider.py` — `test_bedrock_default_model` updated to assert `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` as default; added `-> None` return type annotations to all new test methods in `TestIsBedrockModelId` and `TestBedrockRoutingAffinity`.
- `tests/test_all_providers_discovery.py` — `test_bedrock_discovery` updated to assert new default model `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`.

### Added
- `tests/test_model_router.py` — Added 5 tests for the 4 new Bedrock `ModelCapability` registry entries: `test_bedrock_opus_4_7_in_registry`, `test_bedrock_opus_4_6_v1_in_registry`, `test_bedrock_sonnet_4_6_in_registry`, `test_bedrock_haiku_4_5_in_registry`, and `test_bedrock_models_route_as_passthrough` (verifies all 4 IDs are correctly served as passthrough routing decisions).

### Added
- `.github/workflows/ci-failure-autofix.yml` — CI failure auto-fix workflow: triggers on any CI failure on non-master branches, reproduces the failure, calls Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Anthropic API to generate a patch, applies and verifies it, then commits the fix directly to the branch. Opens a GitHub issue if the fix is too complex or the patch fails verification.
- `tests/test_bedrock_provider.py` — `test_bedrock_affinity_preserved_in_cooldown_bypass`: asserts that NIM is not attempted for Bedrock model IDs even in the cooldown-bypass path.
- `provider_router.py` — `_is_bedrock_model_id()` helper and Bedrock routing affinity: requests whose model ID starts with `us.anthropic.*`, `eu.anthropic.*`, `global.anthropic.*`, `arn:aws:bedrock:*`, or `anthropic.claude-*` are now routed exclusively to the `bedrock` provider, bypassing Nvidia NIM and other providers that cannot serve them.
- `router/registry.py` — Added `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` (Opus 4.6, confirmed accessible) and `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` to the model capability registry.
- `tests/test_bedrock_provider.py` — Tests for `_is_bedrock_model_id` (10 cases) and Bedrock routing affinity (3 integration tests including NIM bypass and primary-provider correctness).
- `tests/test_bedrock_live.py` — Live E2E tests for AWS Bedrock (auto-skipped without credentials): direct boto3 ping, model accessibility, ProviderRouter round-trip, health check.

### Changed
- `render.yaml` — All agent role models (`AGENT_PLANNER_MODEL`, `AGENT_EXECUTOR_MODEL`, `AGENT_VERIFIER_MODEL`, `AGENT_JUDGE_MODEL`) and coding runtime models (`OPENCODE_MODEL`, `AIDER_MODEL`, `GOOSE_MODEL`) set to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1` (Claude Opus 4.6 via AWS Bedrock — highest confirmed-accessible Opus model). Previous defaults were Nvidia NIM free-tier models.
- `render.yaml` — Added `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` env var entries (documented for Render dashboard sync).
- `render.yaml` — `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` default set to `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`; Opus 4.7 requires AWS Sales approval.
### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — Downgraded futuristic GitHub Action versions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-python@v6`) to current stable releases (`v4`, `v5`, etc.) across all workflow files to prevent "Action not found" errors.
- `.github/scripts/*.py` — Fixed `from __future__ import annotations` placement; moved to the very beginning of files (before docstrings) to ensure compatibility with Python 3.13.
- `.github/workflows/openclaw-security-automation.yml` & `.github/scripts/security_fix_agent.py` — Changed OpenClaw working directory from `/app/openclaw` to `${{ github.workspace }}/openclaw` to avoid permission issues in GitHub Actions environments.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Updated Git initialization to use `master` as the default branch for consistency with the repository's primary branch.
- `.github/workflows/openclaw-security-automation.yml` — Made `git push origin master` non-fatal; the push fails when branch protection requires PRs, which was causing the whole workflow run to fail. Now emits a workflow warning instead of a hard failure.
### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` — Fixed three bugs: (1) `- '!master'` was indented as a sibling of `branches:` rather than a child, so master pushes incorrectly triggered the workflow; (2) missing `GH_TOKEN` env on the "Check if PR already exists" step caused `gh` CLI to fail auth silently; (3) `gh pr create --label auto-created` returned HTTP 422 when the `auto-created` label didn't exist — added a prior step that upserts the label.
- `.github/workflows/openclaw-security-automation.yml` — `issues.create()` with `labels: ['security', 'automated']` returned HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) when those labels didn't exist in the repo; added a label-upsert guard (getLabel → createLabel on 404) before issue creation.
- `frontend/package.json` — Added `jest.moduleNameMapper` for `react-router-dom` and `react-router` so jest 27 (react-scripts v5) can resolve react-router-dom v7's exports-only package without falling back to the non-existent `dist/main.js` entry.

### Security
- `.github/workflows/changelog-check.yml` — Move `PR_TITLE`, `BASE_SHA`, `HEAD_SHA` to `env:` block to prevent shell injection (CWE-78).
- `.github/workflows/process-quick-note.yml` — Move `issue_number` workflow input to `ISSUE_NUMBER_OVERRIDE` env var to prevent shell injection.

### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/agency-cycle.yml` — Change `pip install bandit safety 2>&1 | tail -2` to `-q` so pip errors are not silently swallowed.
- `pytest.ini` — Add `filterwarnings = ignore::pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` to suppress Python 3.13 GC timing noise.
- `tests/conftest.py` — Add `_gc_before_loop_close` session fixture to force GC before the event loop closes on Python 3.13, preventing `PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning` from orphaned subprocess transports.

### Added
- `agent/repowise.py`, `agent/tools.py` — Implemented Repowise-inspired codebase intelligence tools: `get_overview`, `get_context`, `get_risk`, and `get_why` for enhanced agent reasoning.
### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/weekly-trend-digest.yml` — Fixed failing "Fetch & Digest AI Trends" job: the workflow was installing only `httpx`, but importing `agent.trend_watcher` triggers `agent/__init__.py` which pulls in the full agent stack (`agent.loop`, `provider_router`, `router`, etc.). Changed to install `requirements.txt` so all transitive dependencies are available.
- `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`, `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` — Removed reference to non-existent `actions/setup-cli@v1` action (marketplace returns 404). `gh` CLI is pre-installed on `ubuntu-latest` runners; no setup step is needed.
- `.github/workflows/openclaw-security-automation.yml` — Replaced binary-corrupted YAML file with a clean, valid workflow. Also fixed OpenClaw installation to clone from `github.com/openclaw/openclaw` (git clone) instead of `npm install openclaw@latest` (package does not exist on npm).
- `.github/workflows/agency-cycle.yml` (PR #185) — Fixed invalid `actions/checkout@v6` and `actions/setup-python@v6` references; bumped to `@v4` and `@v5` respectively (highest available versions).
- Updated primary LLM to `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` and configured `MoonshotAI: Kimi K2.6` as high-priority fallback to resolve 404/429 errors in GitHub Actions and improve routing reliability.
- `.github/workflows/openclaw-maintenance.yml`, `docs/runbooks/openclaw-setup.md`, `docs/architecture/agent-orchestration.md` — Updated OpenClaw repository URLs to point to the new location at `github.com/openclaw/openclaw`.
- `agent/github_tools.py` — Fixed syntax errors regarding misplaced future imports.
- `agent/loop.py` — Enforced 'real work' requirement for edit/create tasks; increased max tool calls per step to 50.
- `runtimes/health.py` — Increased health check timeouts to 60s and circuit-breaker threshold to 10 failures to improve system uptime and reduce transient 'offline' status.
- `runtimes/api.py` — Sanitized error messages to prevent stack trace and internal information exposure.
- `agent/tools.py` — Implemented strict path traversal prevention using robust prefix validation.
- `.github/scripts/security_fix_agent.py` — Fixed OpenClaw execution path.
- `.github/workflows/openclaw-security-automation.yml` — Restored corrupted workflow file.
- `direct_chat.py` — Improved triviality filters to better handle coding-related requests in agent mode; fixed syntax errors.


### Fixed
- `runtimes/control.py` — Expanded Docker-socket error detection to handle overlay mount failures in CI; added port-conflict resolution by killing existing processes on target ports before starting local runtimes.
- `runtimes/api.py` — Updated `/start` and `/stop` endpoints to return informational 200 payloads for remote-managed or Docker-unavailable environments; sanitized error messages to prevent stack trace exposure.
- `agent/github_tools.py` — Fixed directory creation for local workspaces to ensure parent directories exist; added input sanitization to prevent path injection.
- `direct_chat.py` — Add Git/GitHub preflight checks for repo-related agent prompts: validates presence of GitHub token and 'git' binary and performs best-effort token validation (GitHub API) to detect invalid tokens or missing 'repo' scopes.
- `agent/job_manager.py` — Normalize job results to expose a canonical `result.response` and `final_message` for client consumption; preserve raw runner payload under `result.raw`.
- `runtimes/adapters/internal_agent.py` — Conservative health probe: when Ollama is used (no NVIDIA key), perform a lightweight probe and mark the runtime unavailable if Ollama is unreachable to avoid routing into broken local runtimes.

### Changed
- `runtimes/adapters/internal_agent.py` — Increased default `max_steps` from 8 to 30 and improved task success criteria to allow purely informational tasks to succeed.
- `agent/prompts.py` — Raised planner step limit to 30 to support advanced coding tasks.
- `.github/scripts/implement_agent.py` — Enhanced with `search_code` tool and increased turn limits to match backend capabilities.

### Removed
- None.

## [v4.1.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- `agent/repowise.py`, `agent/tools.py` — Implemented Repowise-inspired codebase intelligence tools: `get_overview`, `get_context`, `get_risk`, and `get_why` for enhanced agent reasoning.
- **Vision request routing** (`router/registry.py`, `router/model_router.py`) — the proxy now auto-detects `image_url` content parts in incoming chat requests and routes them to the highest-tier vision-capable model registered in the capability registry. Vision capability is declared via the new `vision: bool` field on `ModelCapability`. Affected models: `gemma4:27b`, `gemma4:9b`, `gemma4:latest`, `llama4-maverick:17b`, `llama4-scout:17b`, `qwen3.6:35b`. Set `VISION_MODEL=<name>` env var to pin to a specific vision model. Manual `X-Model-Override` header still takes priority.

### Added
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` / `X-Session-Id` propagation in Langfuse traces** (`langfuse_obs.py`, `chat_handlers.py`) — the proxy now extracts `X-Session-Id` and `X-Claude-Code-Session-Id` request headers and attaches them to Langfuse traces as `sessionId` (groups all turns from one session under a single trace in Langfuse) and as a `session:<id>` tag. All streaming and non-streaming paths are covered. The `session_id` field also appears in the trace metadata dict.

### Added
- **`FEATURE_DISABLE` / `FEATURE_ENABLE` bulk env vars** (`features/matrix.py`) — operators can now enable or disable multiple features at once via comma-separated lists, e.g. `FEATURE_DISABLE=jcode_runtime,social_auth`. `FEATURE_DISABLE` is authoritative (wins over `FEATURE_ENABLE` if both list the same ID). Unknown IDs in either list emit a WARNING log. Single-feature `FEATURE_<ID>=<tier>` overrides continue to work.

### Added
- **`FeatureMatrix.check()` alias** (`features/matrix.py`) — adds `check(feature_id)` as a direct alias for `check_available()`, matching the originally-planned public API.

### Added
- **`FeatureMatrix.summary()` method** (`features/matrix.py`) — returns a compact list of all features (feature_id, display_name, maturity, enabled) suitable for status endpoints and admin UI consumers.

### Added
- **`proxy_endpoints` feature entry** (`features/matrix.py`) — added the missing stable `proxy_endpoints` registry entry so `FeatureMatrix.check("proxy_endpoints")` works correctly.

### Added
- **`as_dict()` enhancements** (`features/matrix.py`) — `FeatureMatrix.as_dict()` now returns `schema_version: "1"`, a top-level `entries` list (for consumers that prefer arrays over keyed maps), and a top-level `by_maturity` dict alongside the existing `features` dict and `summary` block.
