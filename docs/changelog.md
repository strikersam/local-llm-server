# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `.python-version` — pinned to `3.13` to match CI (`python-version: ["3.13"]` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`); local pytest environment reinstalled with Python 3.13 so version-specific behaviour (event-loop enforcement, etc.) is caught locally before CI.

### Fixed
- `tests/conftest.py` — aligned `V3_ADMIN_EMAIL` with `ADMIN_EMAIL` so backend limited-mode login fallback uses the same admin email as the test fixtures (`admin@llmrelay.local`); pinned `JWT_SECRET` to a deterministic CI value to prevent random secret mismatch between login and subsequent requests.
- `runtimes/control.py` — added `_is_docker_unavailable()` helper with expanded Docker-socket error patterns (`docker.sock`, `daemon is running`, `failed to connect to the docker`); `POST /runtimes/{id}/start` now returns an informational 200 payload instead of 500 when the Docker socket is absent.
- `backend/server.py` — wrapped all bare MongoDB `await` calls in `chat_send`, `list_providers`, `get_active_provider`, and `_list_configured_provider_records` with `try/except` and sensible limited-mode fallbacks, preventing `ServerSelectionTimeoutError` from propagating to test clients when MongoDB is unreachable.
- `backend/server.py` — `JWTUserStateMiddleware` now applies the same admin-email limited-mode fallback as `get_current_user` when `ObjectId(payload["sub"])` raises `bson.errors.InvalidId`, ensuring `request.state.user` is populated for task/agent routes in CI without MongoDB.
- `backend/server.py` — `get_current_user` outer `except` clause split so `HTTPException` is re-raised as-is instead of being swallowed as `"Invalid token"`, fixing false 401s on the task creation endpoint in limited mode.
- `backend/server.py` — `GET /api/health` no longer propagates `ServerSelectionTimeoutError`; `get_active_provider()` returns `None` gracefully when MongoDB is down.
- `backend/server.py` — `GET /api/providers` returns built-in provider defaults (including `anthropic-universal`) via new `_builtin_provider_records()` helper when MongoDB is unavailable.
- `tests/test_iteration_7_features.py` — `TestHealthEndpoint` assertion updated to accept `"degraded"` alongside `"ok"` since no-MongoDB CI environments correctly report degraded status.
- `runtimes/health.py` — `RuntimeHealthService.stop()` now catches `RuntimeError` alongside `CancelledError`; Python 3.13 raises `RuntimeError: Task attached to a different loop` when a background task created during TestClient startup is awaited during pytest-asyncio teardown.

- Added `self-improve` skill: enables the agent to audit and enhance its own skill library
- Added `issue-resolver` skill: structured end-to-end process for resolving GitHub issues
- Added `skill-composer` skill: orchestration layer for combining multiple skills into coordinated workflows
- Added `git-hygiene` skill: ensures clean git history, valid commit messages, and safe pushes before merging
- Added `task-scoper` skill: prevents scope creep by explicitly defining task boundaries before implementation begins
